# Web Service Spring
> Project developed using spring boot for the discipline of concurrent programming and distributed systems.
## :information_source: Information 

The project aims to develop two clients and a server. Client 1 will only send information to the server. Client 2 does not send the information, but requests the data that Client 1 sent to the server, such as:
- the last data entered
- hourly search of data sent by the client 1
- the search for the data id sent by the client 1

This data that client 1 is going to send is composed of the attributes of: date, time, temperature, humidity and luminosity. And client 2 just retrieves the information. Spring is already configured in the project in the pom file.
